#Start

The Raspberry Pi Pico needs firmware.  I gave you a fresh one. This is an adventure. Buckle up. The example code here uses CircuitPython but if you want to you can use something else.
its up to you.

1. Familiarize yourself with the Pico.  There's a great introduction on the adafruit website at: https://learn.adafruit.com/getting-started-with-raspberry-pi-pico-circuitpython  
2. Follow the instructions for setting up the Pico macropad here: https://learn.adafruit.com/diy-pico-mechanical-keyboard-with-fritzing-circuitpython/overview but stop at the code page.  And don't worry about 3d printing.  We aren't doing that right now...or if you don't stop at the code, just realize that you will have to alter it to work in this situation.  
3. Go to the page in this repository for the code.  You can cut and paste it into the editor or you can mess with it and change it as you see fit.  Its yours.
