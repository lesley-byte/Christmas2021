Start

The Raspberry Pi Pico needs firmware.  I gave you a fresh one. This is an adventure. Buckle up. The example code here uses CircuitPython but if you want to you can use something else.
its up to you.

1. Familiarize yourself with the Pico.  There's a great introduction on the adafruit website at: https://learn.adafruit.com/getting-started-with-raspberry-pi-pico-circuitpython  
2. Follow the instructions for setting up the Pico macropad here: https://learn.adafruit.com/diy-pico-mechanical-keyboard-with-fritzing-circuitpython/overview but stop at the code page.  And don't worry about 3d printing.  We aren't doing that right now...or if you don't stop at the code, just realize that you will have to alter it to work in this situation.  The attached usb cable can be used.  If you want to use your own cable, thats fine, just make sure it is a data cable and not just a charging cable.
3. Go to the page in this repository for the code.  You can cut and paste it into the editor or you can mess with it and change it as you see fit.  Its yours.  
4. Keyboard assembly:
  -Make sure your code is saved.
  -Eject/detach Pico from your computer.
  -Plug Pico into Christmas keyboard.
  -Plug assembled Christmas keyboard into  your computer.  It will pop up as a usb drive.  There is a way around this with code if it becomes annoying.  Its just easier to change    the code if it acts like a usb drive.  Close the popped up folder and use it like a keyboard, macropad, whatever you want.
